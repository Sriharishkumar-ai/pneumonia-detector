# 🩺 X-ray Pneumonia Detector

**X-ray Pneumonia Detector** is an AI-powered web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built with Flask, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, it provides a simple web interface where users (doctors, students, HR, or reviewers) can upload an image and instantly receive a diagnostic prediction.
