## ❓ What is this project?

This project is a **binary image classification tool** to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides:

✅ High-level accuracy (95%+) on validation data  
✅ Intuitive **Streamlit** web interface for easy usage  
✅ Deployable on Hugging Face Spaces or any cloud platform

---

## 💡 Why Pneumonia Detection?

- Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity worldwide, especially in children under 5 and elderly populations.  
- Early detection aids in **timely treatment and reduced mortality**.  
- Automated AI models assist radiologists and clinicians in rapid screening.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This model is for educational and research purposes only and is **not validated for clinical use**.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Chest X-ray images are preprocessed (resized, normalized).  
2. **Model Training:** A CNN is trained to classify images as Pneumonia or Normal.  
3. **Streamlit Deployment:** Users can upload their X-ray image to obtain instant predictions.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset: **Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset**  
- Contains images labelled as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*.  
- [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) (download externally due to size).

---

## 🧠 Model

- **Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.  
- **Input Size:** 256x256 grayscale images.  
- **Output:** Binary class (Pneumonia / Normal).

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This app can be deployed on:

✅ **Hugging Face Spaces** (recommended)  
✅ Heroku  
✅ Streamlit Community Cloud
